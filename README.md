# omarchy-doom-theme
A material based omarchy theme created of off the MF Doom wallpaper in the dharmx / walls repository

I couldnt particularly find a theme for Omarchy that I could just stare in awe at. I went about creating my own theme utilising [Aether](https://github.com/bjarneo/aether) and [Omarchist](https://github.com/tahayvr/omarchist) based on a wallpaper I have always loved from the [dharmx's walls repo](https://github.com/dharmx/walls). This was the result! I hope you enjoy, I look forward to further customising the 
theme and adding more changes
